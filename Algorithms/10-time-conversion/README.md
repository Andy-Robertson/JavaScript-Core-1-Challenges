# Time Conversion
In this activity you will design a function that takes a time string in the format `"hh:mm:ss"` and returns the total number of seconds. 

## Instructions

- Open [time-conversion.js](time-conversion.js) in your code editor -- **this is the only file you will modify in this activity.**

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `timeConversion` function to achieve the following:

    - Return the total number of seconds present.

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [test.html](test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that _pass_ the tests will be denoted with a **green check mark**.

  - Functions that _fail_ the tests will be denoted with a **red x and an error message**.
